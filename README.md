# Synopsis
Efficient bookkeeping is essential for business 
operations, but manually encoding receipts can be time-consuming and error-prone. This study develops an automated 
system to extract structured data from receipts using 
machine learning, streamlining the bookkeeping process. The 
proposed system utilizes OCR and [LayoutLMv3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/layoutlmv3) model, a state-of-the-art pre-trained model for document layout analysis 
and information extraction. A Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) algorithm validates receipt authenticity prior to 
processing.
